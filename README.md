# Living-Style-Guide

This is a Style Guide of an app "Adopt a tree".

Style Guide documents design and it is a UI library of : 

	1. Global Styles( Colors, Spacing, Media queries, Grids, Alignment, Icons, Typography helpers)
	1. HTML Elements( Typography, Images, Buttons, Forms) 
	1. Copmponents( Simple components, Complex components & some Third-party plugin components)
	1. States( Empty, Loading)I

I've build this Guide following the [Living Style Guide with SASS and Vanilla JS](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-living-style-guide-sass-vanilla-javascript/table-of-contents) crash course offered by Pluralsight
